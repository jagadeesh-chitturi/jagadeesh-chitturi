# üëã Hey! I'm Jagadeesh Chitturi
I am a data engineerüë®‚Äçüíª by profession with a robust background in developing sophisticated statistical models and simulations. My most recent project involved creating an Agent-Based Model for forecasting mosquitoü¶ü populations in Miami, United States, as part of my work as a Graduate Research Assistant under a professor and his team from the School of Public Health at Indiana University Bloomington. This model achieved an impressive 94% accuracy in simulating mosquito populations, providing a reliable foundation for testing mosquito control techniques, including the use of Genetically Modified mosquitoes.<br><br>My expertise lies in handling complex datasets, transforming raw data into actionable insights, and developing scalable data pipelines that facilitate efficient data analysis and model training. I have extensive experience in:<br><br>Data Modeling and Simulation: Designed and developed statistical models to predict the spread of viral infectious diseases, demonstrating a keen ability to translate complex biological phenomena into accurate computational models.<br>Data Pipeline Construction: Skilled in constructing robust data pipelines that automate the collection, cleaning, and integration of large datasets, ensuring data quality and accessibility for analysis.<br>Database Management: Proficient in managing databases, optimizing data storage, and ensuring data integrity, with a focus on enhancing the performance of data retrieval and manipulation operations.<br>Data Processing and Analysis: Expert in applying advanced data processing techniques to prepare data for analysis, including the use of machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns and predict trends.<br>I am currently seeking opportunities to collaborate on data engineering projects where I can apply my skills in data processing, analysis, and model development to contribute to meaningful insights and solutions. My goal is to leverage my background in public health research and my expertise in data engineering to impact decision-making processes and outcomes in various domains.<br><br>Feel free to explore my GitHub portfolio to see the projects I've worked on and the contributions I've made.<br><br>ü§ùI'm looking to collaborate on Data Engineering Projects<br>Currently working on Data Modeling and ETL/ELT pipelines.<br>üì¨You can contact me on <a href="mailto:chitturijagadeesh97@gmail.com">Email Me</a>. <br> üìúKnow better on my experiences here <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCDc_alUtM2rMfu0i9V1r09wU2Uq2F5u/view?usp=drive_link">Resume</a>
